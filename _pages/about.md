## About me

I work as a front-office data scientist at an Australian investment bank based in Sydney. My skillset is the intersection of financial markets domain experience, data science and technology entrepreneurship which I use to develop innovative solutions to problems mainly in the financial markets domain.

In my time I develop trading & investment models across all asset classes including alternatives (betting markets such as horse racing). This involves technical solutions involving quantitative alpha research, backtesting and portfolio optimisation. I have built full-stack solutions including bots across front and back-office markets businesses, interactive dashboards used by global business and NLP-driven research apps as some of my projects. I also enjoy modelling sports (fantasy sports competitions) and am live-testing a comprehensive Australian horse racing model.
